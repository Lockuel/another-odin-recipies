                <li>125g Unsalted butter (softened) </li>
                <li>115g Billington's Unrefined Light Muscovado Sugar </li>
                <li>110g Silver Spoon White Caster Sugar </li>
                <li>1 Medium egg </li>
                <li>1 tsp Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Extract </li>
                <li>220g Allinson's Self Raising Flour </li>
                <li>0.5 tsp Salt </li>
                <li>200g Chocolate chips (tend to find white chocolate works best) </li>

            <h3 class = "heads">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees C, line 2 baking trays with baking parchment</li>
                <li>Cream the butter and sugars into a large mixing bowl until pale and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla extract and mix until smooth</li>
                <li>Sift in flour and salt, mix thouroughly until a soft dough forms. Stir in chocolate chips</li>
                <li>Break off walnut-sized pieces of the dough and roll into balls. Alternatively, you could use an ice cream scoop to portion out the cookies to ensure they are all an equal size. Place these on the baking trays, leaving 3-4 cm between each dough ball as they will spread out during baking. </li>
                <li>Place into oven and cook for 8 minutes. Remove and leave to cool for 10 minutes</li>
            </ol>
